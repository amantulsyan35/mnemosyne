# Mnemosyne

In a world overflowing with information, true knowledge is often lost in the noise. We consume vast amounts of content daily, yet only fragments stay with us. Mnemosyne is an attempt to bridge this gapâ€”an evolving memory-enhanced search engine that transforms personal data into a meaningful, retrievable knowledge system.

At its core, Mnemosyne is about remembering what matters. Instead of relying on external algorithms to dictate relevance, it reintroduces forgotten insights, surfaces connections across time, and helps build a personal narrative of learning. It is not just a search engine but a tool for reflection, rediscovery, and deeper engagement with information.
